      <h2>World war 1</h2>
      <p>World War I, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from July 28, 1914, to November 11, 1918. It involved many of the world's great powers, divided into two main alliances: the Allies (including France, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, and later the United States) and the Central Powers (led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria).

         Causes of World War I
         Several long-term and immediate factors led to the war:
         <ul>
            <li>Militarism: An arms race, especially between Germany and Britain, created a climate of military readiness.</li>
            <li>Alliances: Complex systems of alliances meant that a conflict between two nations could quickly escalate.</li>
            <li>Imperialism: Competition for colonies and global influence heightened tensions.</li>
            <li>Nationalism: Ethnic pride and desires for independence, especially in the Balkans, destabilized empires.</li>
            <li>Immediate Trigger: The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist.
        </ul>


         <p>This event prompted Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia, setting off a chain reaction due to the alliance system.</p>
        <p id = "Major Fronts">Major Fronts
            <ul>
                <li>Western Front: Stretched across France and Belgium. Characterized by trench warfare, with little movement and high casualties (e.g., Battles of the Somme, Verdun).</li>
                <li>Eastern Front: Fought between Germany/Austria-Hungary and Russia. More mobile, but also deadly.</li>
                <li>Italian Front: Between Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Alps.</li>
                <li>Balkan Front: Involved Serbia, Bulgaria, and others.</li>
                <li>Middle Eastern Front: British and Allied forces fought the Ottoman Empire (e.g., Gallipoli Campaign, campaigns
                 <li>Naval Warfare: Included battles like Jutland and Germany’s use of unrestricted submarine warfare.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>1914: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand; Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia.</li>
                <li>1914-1915: Stalemate on the Western Front; trench warfare becomes the norm.</li>
                <li>1915: Italy joins the Allies; Gallipoli Campaign fails for the Allies.</li>
                <li>1916: Battle of Verdun and Battle of the Somme result in massive casualties.</li>
                <li>1917: United States enters the war; Russia exits after the Bolshevik Revolution.</li>
                <li>1918: German Spring Offensive fails; Allied counteroffensive leads to the end of the war.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p id = "End of the War">End of the War
             The Armistice of November 11, 1918, ended the fighting.
              The Treaty of Versailles (1919) formally ended the war with Germany, imposing heavy reparations, territorial losses, and military restrictions.
             Other treaties (e.g., Treaty of Saint-Germain, Treaty of Sèvres) redrew the map of Europe and the Middle East.

         <p id = "Consequences">Consequences
            <ul>
                <li>Human Cost: Over 16 million deaths (military and civilian) and 20 million wounded.</li>
                <li>Political Changes: Collapse of empires (German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, Ottoman).</li>
                <li>New Nations: Creation of countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia.</li>
                <li>League of Nations: Established to prevent future wars (precursor to the UN).</li>
                <li>Economic Hardship: Led to instability, contributing to the Great Depression and the rise of extremist movements (e.g., Nazism in Germany).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
           World War I fundamentally changed global politics, society, and warfare, setting the stage for World War II just two decades later.</p>
